                    <p>We desire relationships because that is how God made us. He created us in His image and put us on
                        earth to enjoy His presence and glorify Him.</p>
                    <p>Genesis 1-2 &nbsp; Leviticus 26:12 &nbsp; John 15:1-17</p>

                    <h1>Our sins separate us from God.</h1>
                    <p>God is holy and perfect, and we are not. We have all chosen sin, which is any way we have broken
                        God's law or rebelled against Him. Because we have sinned against our holy and perfect God, our
                        relationship with Him is broken, and we deserve due punishment for our sin. The punishment for
                        sin is death and separation from God. Both now in this life, and for all of eternity in hell.
                    </p>
                    <p>Isaiah 59:2 &nbsp; Romans 3:23, 6:23 &nbsp; Galatians 3:10 &nbsp; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</p>

                    <h1>Sins cannot be removed by good deeds.</h1>
                    <p>No amount of our good deeds can make up for our sins. It's like using a patch of fabric to cover
                        up a stain on a t-shirt. Under-neath the fabric, the stain will still exist. We cannot do good
                        things to earn forgiveness from God in the same way a judge will not forgive robbery because the
                        criminal also gave money to charity. God is a holy and perfect Judge who demands holy and
                        perfect justice for our sin. Just as a judge must punish wrongdoing, God must punish us for our
                        sin. The punishment for sin is death and eternal separation from Him.</p>
                    <p>Isaiah 64:6 &nbsp; Romans 3:20 &nbsp; Ephesians 2:8-9 &nbsp; Genesis 18:25 &nbsp; Proverbs 17:15</p>

                    <h1>Paying the price for sin, Jesus died and rose again.</h1>
                    <p>While God is holy and just, He is also loving and merciful and has provided a way for us to be
                        reconciled to Him. God entered humanity on our behalf as Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus lived a
                        perfect, sinless life yet took our punishment and died in our place. Through His torturous death
                        on the cross, Jesus paid the price for our sins, bearing the wrath of God for us. His death
                        satisfied God's demands for justice, and His perfect life satisfied God's demands for holiness.
                        Three days later, He rose from the dead, proving that all He did and said was true and that He
                        has power over sin and death.</p>

                        cover their sin receives eternal salvation as a free gift-not by our good works or deeds but by
                        God's grace. Everyone who believes Jesus rose from the dead, and confesses with their mouth that
                        He is Lord will be saved. To the one who believes, their debt will be forgiven and they will
                        spend eternity with God in heaven.</p>

                        immediately and lasts into eternity. Miraculously, God gives us His Spirit so that we have power
                        over sin and can live a life of righteousness and love for God.</p>

                    <h1>How To Respond:</h1>
                    <p>If you believe this message and want to put your faith in Jesus, the best place to start is
                        prayer as you acknowledge the previous six truths to God. Scripture shows us that we are able to
                        pray and talk with God, just like we may talk with a friend or father. (See Matthew 6:9-13,
                        11:28-30; and 1 Peter 5:6-7)</p>
                    <p>Then, you must acknowledge and repent of your sin to God. Repentance simply means turning from
                        your own way, and following God's way instead. You don’t only repent with your words, but
                        through your actions as well. Genuine recognition and repentance of your sin will lead to
                        genuine sorrow, and a hatred for your sin. As you acknowledge your sin before God, also
                        acknowledge your need for a Savior and that you believe Jesus died and rose from the dead to
                        offer you forgiveness for your sin and that He is now your Savior!</p>
                    <p>Thank God for His forgiveness and grace! Genuine repentance and salvation will cause us to
                        rejoice and desire to follow Jesus wholeheartedly. Jesus must be our Savior AND Lord. We can't
                        receive His forgiveness while rejecting Him as Lord of our lives. God calls us to leave our life
                        of sin and selfishness, and live for Him instead. Scripture goes so far as to say that we are a
                        new creation; before salvation we're dead, but now we are alive!</p>
                    <p>The next steps are joining a church that preaches Christ and the Bible; setting aside time each
                        day to focus on God through prayer and reading His word; and developing relationships with
                        people who can help you grow in your relationship with Jesus. If you have questions or want to
